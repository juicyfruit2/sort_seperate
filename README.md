# sort_seperate

- Using the following array: [27, -3, 4, 5, 35, 2, 1, -40, 7, 18, 9, -1, 16, 100]
- Create a Python script called sort_and_search.py
- Which searching algorithm would be appropriate to use on the given list?
- Implement this searching algorithm to search for the number 9. Add a
- comment to explain why you think this algorithm was a good choice.
- Research and implement the Insertion sort on this array.
- Implement a searching algorithm you havenâ€™t tried yet in this Task on the
sorted array to find the number 9.
- Add a comment to explain where you
would use this algorithm in the real world
